# Find-A-Lens Application Details

Find-A-Lens is a web application designed for photographers to find their next lens
purchase.

If you are a photographer, you know that good lenses are insanely expensive and often cost upwards of $2,000 or more.
Photographers research lenses to no end before buying, and while there are lots of decent reviews of lenses available
on the Internet, there really isn't anything out there to help walk you through the process of selecting a lens.


## Project Development Instructions
This application is based on AngularJS and NodeJS.
To run this application, you must install NodeJS.
`cd` into your desired directory and then `git clone` the repository.
After you clone the repository, you can install the project's dependencies.  To do so, run the following command:

     npm install

Doing so will not only install [NPM](https://www.npmjs.org/) development dependencies, but will also install [Bower](http://bower.io) production dependencies.
To add/remove dependencies you can modify the package.json file (development), and the bower.json file (production).

You can run the application on your local machine by running the following command:

     npm start

CSS is handled through SASS. In order to compile your SASS/SCSS files, run the following command:

     grunt

This will compile the proper CSS files for the project.
