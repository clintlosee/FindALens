This application is based on AngularJS and NodeJS.  To run this application, you must install NodeJS.  After you clone the repository, you can install the project's dependencies.  To do so, run the following command:

```
npm install
```

Doing so will not only install NPM development dependencies, but will also install BOWER production dependencies.  To add/remove dependencies you can modify the package.json file (development), and the bower.json file (production).

You can run the application on your local machine by running the following command:

```
npm start
```
